    "Assignment expressions (also known as the \"walrus operator\") allow you to assign values to variables within an expression.\n",
    "Positional-only parameters for functions, which allow you to specify which function parameters can only be passed positionally (i.e., not by keyword).\n",

    "Generator comprehension is a concise way to create a generator object in Python using a single line of code. It is similar to list comprehension, but instead of creating a list, it creates a generator object that can be iterated over lazily. The syntax for generator comprehension is similar to list comprehension, but with parentheses instead of square brackets. For example, the following code creates a generator object that yields the squares of the numbers in the range 0 to 9:\n",
